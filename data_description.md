# Financial Metrics Glossary

## Introduction: What You Need to Know First
Before diving into the specifics, it's important to understand the big picture. These metrics are key indicators used in fundamental analysis of publicly traded companies. They help investors evaluate a stock's value, performance, growth potential, and risk. 

- **Start with identifiers** (like Ticker and CIK): These uniquely identify the company.
- **Time and reporting basics** (FiscalYearEnd, LatestQuarter): Understand the company's reporting calendar.
- **Core financials** (RevenueTTM, EBITDA, EPS): Measure size, profitability, and earnings.
- **Valuation ratios** (PERatio, PriceToBookRatio): Assess if the stock is over/undervalued.
- **Growth metrics** (QuarterlyEarningsGrowthYOY): Gauge expansion.
- **Analyst insights** (AnalystTargetPrice): Expert opinions.
- **Technical indicators** (52WeekHigh, 50DayMovingAverage): Short-term price trends.
- **Ownership and dividends** (SharesOutstanding, DividendYield): Structure and shareholder returns.

Data often comes from sources like SEC filings (via CIK), Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg. TTM means "Trailing Twelve Months" (last 12 months). YOY is "Year Over Year." Use these together for a holistic view—e.g., low PERatio with high growth might signal a buy.

Now, detailed explanations for each metric, in the order you listed (with logical groupings for clarity).

## Company Identifiers
- **CIK**: Central Index Key. A unique 10-digit number assigned by the U.S. SEC to identify companies and individuals filing documents. Used to search EDGAR database for financial reports.
- **Ticker**: Stock symbol. A short abbreviation (e.g., AAPL for Apple) used to identify shares on exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ. Essential for trading and quoting prices.

## Reporting Periods
- **FiscalYearEnd**: The last day of a company's fiscal year, which may not align with the calendar year (Dec 31). E.g., Apple's ends September 30. Affects when annual reports are due.
- **LatestQuarter**: The most recent fiscal quarter for which financials are reported (e.g., Q3 ending September 30). Quarterly reports (10-Q) provide updates between annual ones (10-K).

## Market and Size Metrics
- **MarketCapitalization**: Total value of a company's outstanding shares (Share Price × Shares Outstanding). E.g., $2T for mega-caps like Google. Classifies companies as small/mid/large-cap.
- **SharesOutstanding**: Total number of shares issued by the company, including those held by insiders and institutions. Used in cap calculations; diluted versions account for options.
- **SharesFloat**: Shares available for public trading (Shares Outstanding minus restricted/insider-held). Lower float can mean higher volatility.

## Profitability and Earnings
- **EBITDA**: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. Measures operating profitability by excluding non-cash and financing costs. Useful for comparing companies across industries.
- **EPS**: Earnings Per Share. Net income divided by Shares Outstanding. Basic (simple) vs. Diluted (includes convertibles). Higher EPS often signals stronger performance.
- **DilutedEPSTTM**: Diluted EPS over the Trailing Twelve Months. Adjusts for potential share increases from options/warrants, giving a conservative earnings view.
- **ProfitMargin**: Net income as % of revenue. Shows efficiency in turning sales into profit. E.g., 20% means $0.20 profit per $1 revenue.
- **OperatingMarginTTM**: Operating income (after expenses but before interest/taxes) as % of revenue, TTM. Focuses on core business efficiency.
- **GrossProfitTTM**: Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold, over TTM. Indicates production/sales profitability before overhead.
- **ReturnOnAssetsTTM** (ROA): Net income / Total Assets, TTM. Measures how efficiently assets generate profit (e.g., 5% ROA = $5 profit per $100 assets).
- **ReturnOnEquityTTM** (ROE): Net income / Shareholders' Equity, TTM. Gauges profitability from equity investment (e.g., 15% ROE = strong for shareholders).

## Valuation Ratios
- **PERatio**: Price-to-Earnings. Share Price / EPS. E.g., P/E of 20 means investors pay $20 per $1 earnings. Lower may indicate undervaluation; compare to peers/industry.
- **TrailingPE**: P/E using past 12 months' EPS (historical). Reflects current valuation based on realized earnings.
- **ForwardPE**: P/E using estimated future EPS (next 12 months). Forward-looking; lower suggests growth expectations.
- **PEGRatio**: P/E divided by expected EPS growth rate (%). Accounts for growth; <1 may signal undervalued growth stock.
- **PriceToSalesRatioTTM** (P/S): Share Price / Revenue Per Share, TTM. Values company relative to sales (useful for unprofitable firms).
- **PriceToBookRatio** (P/B): Share Price / Book Value Per Share. Compares market value to net assets; <1 may mean undervalued.
- **EVToRevenue**: Enterprise Value (Market Cap + Debt - Cash) / Revenue. Holistic valuation including debt.
- **EVToEBITDA**: EV / EBITDA. Popular for acquisitions; normalizes for capital structure.

## Growth Metrics
- **QuarterlyEarningsGrowthYOY**: % change in EPS from same quarter last year. Positive = accelerating profits.
- **QuarterlyRevenueGrowthYOY**: % change in quarterly revenue vs. prior year. Indicates top-line expansion.
- **RevenuePerShareTTM**: Total revenue / Shares Outstanding, TTM. Sales efficiency per share.
- **RevenueTTM**: Total revenue over last 12 months. Core top-line measure.

## Dividends
- **DividendPerShare**: Annual dividend payout per share. E.g., $2/share means $2 paid yearly.
- **DividendYield**: Annual Dividend Per Share / Share Price × 100. % return from dividends (e.g., 3% yield = attractive for income investors).
- **DividendDate**: Date dividend is paid to shareholders of record.
- **ExDividendDate**: First day without dividend eligibility. Buy before to qualify.

## Risk and Technicals
- **Beta**: Measures stock volatility vs. market (S&P 500 = 1). >1 = more volatile; <1 = defensive.
- **52WeekHigh**: Highest price in past 52 weeks. Resistance level.
- **52WeekLow**: Lowest price in past 52 weeks. Support level.
- **50DayMovingAverage**: Average closing price over 50 days. Short-term trend indicator (above = bullish).
- **200DayMovingAverage**: Average over 200 days. Long-term trend (golden cross: 50DMA > 200DMA = buy signal).

## Ownership
- **PercentInsiders**: % of shares owned by company executives/directors. High = aligned interests; too high = control risk.
- **PercentInstitutions**: % owned by institutions (e.g., mutual funds). High = credibility but potential for herd selling.

## Analyst Opinions
- **AnalystTargetPrice**: Average price target from analysts (e.g., $150). Implies upside/downside from current price.
- **AnalystRatingStrongBuy**: Number of analysts rating "Strong Buy" (highest conviction).
- **AnalystRatingBuy**: Number rating "Buy" (positive but less emphatic).
- **AnalystRatingHold**: Number rating "Hold" (neutral; maintain position).
- **AnalystRatingSell**: Number rating "Sell" (negative).
- **AnalystRatingStrongSell**: Number rating "Strong Sell" (strongest negative).
